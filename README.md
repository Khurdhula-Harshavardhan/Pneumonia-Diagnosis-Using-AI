# Pneumonia-Diagnosis-Using-AI

Pneumonia is a lung inflammation primarily affecting the tiny air sacs, or alveoli. Various pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, can trigger it. Common symptoms encompass coughing, chest discomfort, fever, and breathing challenges.

One pivotal tool in detecting pneumonia is the Chest X-ray. When pneumonia takes hold, the alveoli might fill with pus or fluid, disrupting normal air flow. This obstruction is discernible on X-rays. Specifically, the X-ray can spotlight white opaque regions, hinting at inflammation and fluid buildup, characteristic of pneumonia.

Our new system offers a novel approach: leveraging the power of machine learning to classify these X-ray images as either "normal" or indicative of "pneumonia." Think of it as an expert diagnostic tool, fine-tuned to detect subtle hints and signs on the X-rays. Such a system can drastically elevate diagnostic accuracy.

The importance of timely pneumonia detection cannot be overstated, given its health implications. While the conventional diagnostic approach is heavily reliant on radiologists' keen eyes, our system aims to automate this process. In doing so, it not only expedites diagnosis but also minimizes human errors, making the entire process more efficient and precise.
